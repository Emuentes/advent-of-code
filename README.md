## To run the code for one of the days

Each day's code is in it's own folder for that day.
In those folders, there is a file with the same name as the folder, run that one.

For example, for the Day 1 code challenge it would be:

1. open terminal
1. navigate to the root of this repo
1. run "node day1/day1.js"

Just change the `1` in step three to the number of the day you want to run.
